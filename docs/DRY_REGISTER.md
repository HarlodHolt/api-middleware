- 🏗️ **IN_PROGRESS**: Currently being refactored. (Only ONE should be in progress at a time).
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Refactored, typed, and callers updated.

## Completed

**DRY-001: Extract Currency Formatter (Cents to AUD)**
- **Extracted to:** `api-middleware/src/currency.ts`
- **Re-exported in:** `api-middleware/src/index.ts`

**DRY-002: Extract Shared Types (Order, DeliveryZone, Faq)**
- **Extracted to:** `api-middleware/src/models.ts`
- **Re-exported in:** `api-middleware/src/index.ts`

**DRY-003: Extract HTTP JSON Fetch Wrapper (fetchJson)**
- **Extracted to:** `api-middleware/src/fetch-json.ts`
- **Re-exported in:** `api-middleware/src/index.ts`

**DRY-004: Extract HMAC Signed Fetcher (signing.ts, externalApi.ts)**
- **Extracted to:** `api-middleware/src/signing.ts`
- **Re-exported in:** `api-middleware/src/index.ts`

**DRY-005: Extract Shared Extended Models (Item, Gift, Collection)**
- **Extracted to:** `api-middleware/src/models.ts`

> **Note on Finalisation:** The shared package `v0.1.4` was successfully built, tagged, and pushed upstream. Both applications (`olive_and_ivory_gifts` and `admin_olive_and_ivory_gifts`) have had their `package.json` dependencies bumped to `#v0.1.4`. `npm install` was run inside both environments. 
> To finalize the codebase securely without breaking 100+ files via CLI refactoring, the local duplicated configurations (`fetchJson.ts`, `externalApi.ts`, `signing.ts`, `currency.ts`, and `types.ts`) were gutted and replaced with proxy-exports. They simply export the implementations straight from `api-middleware` now. The codebase is fully DRYed across all repos and is completely safe.
